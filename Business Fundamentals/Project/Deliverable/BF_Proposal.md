# Delivering to Washington DC Food Deserts

Washington DC has long suffered from Food Deserts, that is, residential areas without access to fresh and nutritious food.  DC Hunger Solutions in its recent report, [Still Minding the Grocery Gap in DC: 10th Anniversary Grocery Store Report](https://www.dchunger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/StillMindingGroceryGap.pdf) states that, *Increasing the number of full-service grocery stores and corner stores selling healthy foods is an important strategy for turning food deserts into oases with opportunities to buy healthy foods.* <sup>2</sup> This report comes during a global pandemic, further limiting access to food sources.

Fortunately, there are companies like [4P Foods](https://4pfoods.com), a start-up with a new model of agriculture and a mission to, *Eat Good Food, Change the World: People, Planet, Prosperity, Purpose are the four Pâ€™s of 4P Foods.*  4P Foods focuses on support to  local farmers while ensuring the community has equitable access to the food they produce. During the pandemic 4P Food initially struggled financially with the loss of their wholesale market.  But then, delivery sales accelerated, propelling them to 3-fold growth with over 3500 home deliveries each week. <sup>3</sup>  ***What if 4P Foods could leverage this success to help eliminate the  Washington DC Food Deserts?***

# Analysis

This project will review and assess the extent of the Washington DC Food Deserts in sufficient detail to understand commercial food delivery options.  Subsequent analysis will assess the current 4P Food delivery structure and the potential to deliver nutritious food to these locations. An assessment of benefit to 4P Foods both financially and in service to their mission will be attempted based on publicly available information.

# Data Description

This project will link many different datasets too provide an understanding of the Washington DC food deserts and optimized delivery locations for the residents:

- [WMATA Bus Stops](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/metro-bus-stops/explore)
- [WMATA Metro Stops](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/metro-stations-in-dc/explore)
- [Charity Navigator: Your Guide to Intelligent Giving](https://www.charitynavigator.org)
- [DC Open Data 2020 Census Data](https://planning.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/op/publication/attachments/Table%2010%20-%20Census2020_Blocks_Data.xlsx)
- [DC Open Data Farmers Market Locations](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/farmers-market-locations/explore)
- [DC Open Data Grocery Store Locations](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/grocery-store-locations/explore)
- [USDA Food Access Research Atlas](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/)
- [USDA Community Supported Agriculture Directory](https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/csas)

# Tools

Excel and Tableau will be the primary tools for this project.  The data is largely available in tabular form at record counts suitable for Excel.  Much of the data will be linked and summarized which will leverage Excel's capabilities such as Lookup and Pivot.  Tableau will be the visualization tool for the PowerPoint results. Simple regression strategies may be included to optimize delivery routes.

# MVP Objective

The MVP will present an assessment of the Washington DC food deserts as well as an initial look at the ability of 4P Foods to meet the need.  The results of the MVP will guide subsequent refinement to include delivery routes and benefits.

# Delivering to Washington DC Food Deserts

To date I have been able to aggregate and analyze Washington DC Grocery Store, CSA, and Farmers Market locations as they relate to Washington DC residential addresses. Considering the definition of a Food Desert as a residential address greater than 0.5 mile from a good-quality, fresh food source, I was able to identify a large challenge in Ward 7 and 8 of Washington DC as shown below.

The proposed solution is to set-up weekly fresh food delivery from a company such as 4P Foods to Washington DC neighborhoods by leveraging the Elementary School locations.  By combining Elementary School by Neighborhood with the 2020 Census by Tract Block, the estimated population impacted by food deserts is shown below.

| Cluster | Neighborhood                                                 | Population | Under 18  Population |

Next steps are to consider delivery routes as well as potential business impact of delivering to the highlighted, larger Food Deserts.

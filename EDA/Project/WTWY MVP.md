# Maximizing WTWY Registration

The core question we are attempting to answer is the best deployment of the WTWY street team to NYC MTA subway stations to maximize the number of people who register with the WTWY.  Secondary questions include maximizing the registrants who will (1) be interested in the WYWT programs, (2) attend the gala and (3) contribute to the cause.

To begin to explore these questions, we assessed over 3 months of NYC MTA subway data to determine the daily station entrance and exit traffic.  After cleaning the data and selecting a representative two month dataset, we found the top 25 stations as shown below.





Subsequently we assessed each top station by date and time as well as station entrance location to identify target days, times, and locations for the street team as shown below.



As some of these locations could, by themselves, overwhelm the WYWT street team resources, we have investigated added factors to refine these targets.  We have found that technology oriented university and corporation populations may be most interested in the WYTY programs. Our upcoming work will refine these targets by considering these available datasets:

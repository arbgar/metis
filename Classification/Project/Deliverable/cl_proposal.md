# Saving our Nation's Bridges

The American Road & Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA) reported that, *[There are 171.5 million daily crossings on over 45,000 structurally deficient U.S. bridges in poor condition.](https://artbabridgereport.org/about)* The government classifies a bridge as “structurally deficient”  based on bridge component condition and determines the “sufficiency rating” of a bridge, which is its sufficiency to remain in service.  

Fortunately, ARTBA and others have gained the attention of lawmakers who are earmarking $3.265B for a 5-year Bridge Reinvestment Program under the proposed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. While this is significant funding, it is likely insufficient to address current and future deficiencies.  

# Analysis

This project will review and assess the adequacy of the Infrastructure Investment and Job Act to repair our nations bridges.  In doing so, the analysis will identify key features driving structural deficiency in bridges.  Subsequent analysis will predict the next bridges which may fall into disrepair.  This analysis will help to scope the magnitude of the problem that remains unaddressed.  The outcome of the analysis will yield recommendations for lawmakers, industry associations, and bridge builders.

# Data Description

This project will use the US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration  [National Bridge Inventory](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm) to provide an understanding of the condition of bridges in the United States and the factors driving their deficiencies and sufficiency. The dataset has 732,552 bridges with 123 features.  

# Tools

The analysis will be completed in Jupyter Notebook / Python using Pandas.  Classification analyses, including validation and testing, will use scikit-learn libraries.  Visualization will be via Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau. 

# MVP Objective

The MVP will present an assessment of the adequacy of the Infrastructure Investment and Job Act in addressing structurally deficient bridges.  The MVP will also provide an initial assessment of the key features driving structural deficiency in bridges.   From this MVP assessment a final project scope of predicting bridge sufficiency will be confirmed.

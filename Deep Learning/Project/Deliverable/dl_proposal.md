# Mining Magnificent Mushrooms

[The Mushroom Council](https://www.mushroomcouncil.com/nutrition-benefits/) highlights the many benefits of mushrooms, long considered one of the superfoods we should incorporate in our diet.  Mushrooms are,

- Made up of cancer inhibiting compounds,
- Rich in antioxidants to support a healthy immune system,
- Low-energy-dense foods to manage weight, and
- Umami flavored to reduce need for sodium.

Unfortunately, mushrooms can also be highly toxic resulting in illness and even death.  

There are millions of mushroom species and [about 14,000 described species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom). Of those, [just over 600 are on more than one continent and thought to be edible](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12708).  Readily available in nature, even in urban settings, and beautiful, it is tempting harvest them for dinner.

**But how do you know, delectable or dangerous?**

# Analysis

This project will develop a visual mushroom classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks.  The classifier could be used to identify wild mushrooms found during an urban hike.  This classification could be a first step in understanding if the mushrooms are edible.

# Data Description

This project will use the [University of Copenhagen, Natural History Museum of Denmark Fungi Classification Challenge](https://snm.ku.dk/english/news/all_news/2018/2018.5/the-fungi-classification-challenge/) dataset. As described in the challenge, the dataset consists of 1,394 wild mushrooms species:

- 85,578 training images,
- 4,182 validation images, and
- 9,758 test set images.

Note that this project will use a subset of the data.

# Tools

The analysis will be completed in Jupyter Notebook / Python using Pandas.  Deep Learning  will be TensorFlow Keras  Convolutional Neural Network.  Visualization will be via Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau. 

# MVP Objective

The MVP will present an initial trained model.
